# Welcome to QSLN

## What's QSLN?

Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to
create database-backed web applications according to the
[Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)
pattern.

Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your
application into three layers: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility.
